# SignalBench - Technique Documentation

This document provides detailed information about each MITRE ATT&CK technique implemented in SignalBench, explaining how they work, what telemetry they generate, and what artefacts they create.

## Multi-Category Support

SignalBench supports executing multiple technique categories in a single command, enabling comprehensive telemetry generation across multiple tactics:

```bash
# Generate telemetry for techniques from multiple categories simultaneously
signalbench category discovery execution credential_access --dry-run

# Generate telemetry for all available categories for maximum coverage
signalbench category discovery execution credential_access defence_evasion privilege_escalation command_and_control exfiltration
```

This capability allows security teams to generate realistic telemetry patterns that span multiple tactics within the MITRE ATT&CK framework for analytics development and training scenarios.

## Important: Telemetry Generation Design

SignalBench executes **actual OS commands** that emulate technique-aligned activity patterns whilst remaining safe and non-destructive. This approach generates realistic endpoint telemetry for security analytics:

- Execute actual system commands to generate realistic telemetry
- Establish real network connections for network-based techniques
- Manipulate real files and processes on the system (within controlled parameters)
- Clean up after themselves to leave the system in its original state

This approach generates more realistic endpoint telemetry compared to simple simulations. When running these techniques in an environment with security products, generated signals may be observable depending on sensor configuration and coverage. Many modern security products are simulation-aware and may not generate alerts for research tools by design.

## Cleanup Behaviour and Debugging

By default, SignalBench automatically cleans up all artifacts after technique execution to leave the system in its original state. This ensures no files, directories, or configuration changes persist after telemetry generation.

**For debugging and artifact analysis**, you can preserve all artifacts using the `--no-cleanup` flag:

```bash
# Preserve artifacts for inspection
signalbench run T1059.004 --no-cleanup

# Preserve artifacts when running multiple categories
signalbench category discovery execution --no-cleanup
```

When `--no-cleanup` is used, SignalBench will:
- Skip all cleanup operations after technique execution
- Display the full list of preserved artifacts with their paths
- Leave files, directories, and configuration changes on disk for analysis

This is particularly useful for:
- Examining the exact artifacts generated by each technique
- Debugging technique implementations
- Analyzing telemetry patterns in detail
- Training scenarios where artifact inspection is desired

## SOFTWARE Simulations

The SOFTWARE category contains simulations of known malware families identified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. These simulations use embedded helper binaries that match YARA signatures and behavioural patterns of real malware while remaining completely benign and safe to execute.

### S1109 - PACEMAKER

**EXPERIMENTAL: This implementation represents a research-grade simulation of PACEMAKER malware behaviour. Whilst the binary contains exact YARA signature matches and simulates documented credential-stealing techniques, there is no guarantee that endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools will generate alerts. This simulation has been developed to match Mandiant's technical documentation as closely as possible for security analytics research and training purposes.**

**Description:**  
Deploys a benign simulation of the PACEMAKER credential stealer that matches YARA signatures and behavioural patterns documented in the Mandiant April 2021 Pulse Secure APT investigation. This simulation contains an embedded 64-bit ELF binary with YARA signature strings and simulates the /proc filesystem credential scraping behaviour used by UNC2630 (suspected APT5) in attacks against U.S. Defense Industrial Base companies.

**Attribution:**  
PACEMAKER was used by threat group UNC2630 from August 2020 through March 2021 against U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies. Mandiant assesses that UNC2630 operates on behalf of the Chinese government and may have ties to APT5. The malware was part of a sophisticated toolkit alongside SLOWPULSE, RADIALPULSE, THINBLOOD, and ATRIUM used to compromise Pulse Secure VPN appliances and harvest credentials for lateral movement into victim networks.

**Background:**  
PACEMAKER is a credential-stealing malware documented in Mandiant's April 19, 2021 report "Check Your Pulse: Suspected APT Actors Leverage Authentication Bypass Techniques and Pulse Secure Zero-Day". The malware reads process memory via the /proc filesystem to extract authentication credentials from Pulse Secure VPN daemon processes. It writes harvested credentials to files in /tmp with `.statementcounters` extensions to blend in with legitimate Pulse Secure system files, making detection more difficult.

The malware specifically targets authentication realms used by Pulse Secure VPN including LDAP, RADIUS, and ACE authentication systems, extracting usernames, passwords, and authentication tokens from process memory.

**How it works:**
1. Extracts an embedded 64-bit ELF binary to /tmp/signalbench_sim-pacemaker
2. The binary contains YARA signature strings matching FE_APT_Trojan_Linux_PACEMAKER rules:
   - `/proc/%d/mem` - Used to read process memory for credential extraction
   - `/proc/%s/maps` - Used to locate credential data in memory regions
   - `/proc/%s/cmdline` - Used to identify target Pulse Secure daemon processes
   - `Name:%s || Pwd:%s || AuthNum:%s` - Credential format string for harvested data
3. Creates a launcher script based on the documented PACEMAKER launcher (SHA256: 4c5555955b2e6dc55f52b0c1a3326f3d07b325b112060329c503b294208960ec). Note: The generated script uses different paths (/tmp/signalbench_sim-pacemaker instead of /home/bin/memread) and includes comments, so it will not produce an exact SHA256 match to the original. The functional behaviour remains identical.
4. Simulates realistic /proc filesystem inspection behaviour:
   - Reads /proc/self/maps to simulate memory region scanning
   - Reads /proc/self/cmdline to simulate process identification
   - Attempts to access /proc/self/mem to simulate credential extraction
5. Executes the simulation with parameters: `-t <timeout> -m 16 -s 2` (mimicking memread utility)
6. Creates three credential harvesting files matching Mandiant documentation:
   - /tmp/signalbench_sim_dsactiveuser.statementcounters
   - /tmp/signalbench_sim_dsstartssh.statementcounters
   - /tmp/signalbench_sim_dsserver-check.statementcounters

**Parameters:**
- `timeout`: Timeout in seconds for memread simulation (default: 3)
- `memory_size`: Memory read size in MB (default: 16)
- `scan_interval`: Memory scan interval in seconds (default: 2)

**Artefacts:**
- /tmp/signalbench_sim-pacemaker (ELF binary with YARA signatures, cleaned up automatically)
- /tmp/signalbench_sim-pacemaker-launcher.sh (bash launcher script, cleaned up automatically)
- /tmp/signalbench_sim_dsactiveuser.statementcounters (credential file, cleaned up automatically)
- /tmp/signalbench_sim_dsstartssh.statementcounters (credential file, cleaned up automatically)
- /tmp/signalbench_sim_dsserver-check.statementcounters (credential file, cleaned up automatically)

**YARA Detection:**
This simulation is designed to trigger YARA rules from the Mandiant/FireEye PulseSecure APT report:
- `FE_APT_Trojan_Linux_PACEMAKER`: Detects ELF binaries with proc filesystem strings and credential format
- `FE_APT_Trojan_Linux32_PACEMAKER`: Detects 32-bit ELF binaries with specific x86 byte patterns

To test YARA detection:
```bash
# Run simulation with artifacts preserved
signalbench run S1109 --no-cleanup

# Scan with YARA rules
yara -s pacemaker_rules.yar /tmp/signalbench_sim-pacemaker
```

**Detection opportunities:**
- YARA signature detection (FE_APT_Trojan_Linux_PACEMAKER rules)
- File creation patterns in /tmp/ds*.statementcounters
- Execution of binaries from /tmp directory
- Process memory access patterns (/proc/*/mem, /proc/*/maps access)
- Suspicious process names or command-line arguments
- File naming patterns matching known APT artifacts
- Behavioural analysis of credential harvesting activities
